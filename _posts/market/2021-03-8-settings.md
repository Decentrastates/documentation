## Your Wallet

Before using [market.decentraland.org](https://market.decentraland.org), connect and log into an Ethereum client account that can interact with the web browser. We recommend using [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) or [Mist](https://github.com/ethereum/mist). We also support the use of a [Ledger](https://www.ledgerwallet.com/) hardware wallet.

> Note: If you would like to use your Ledger hardware wallet in the Marketplace, first enable browser support on your device. Next, plug your device into your computer, and select the address you used during the auction. Finally, unlock your wallet and load up the Marketplace.

When navigating the Marketplace, your wallet address is treated as your account, you don't need any additional log in.

Since all transactions in the Ethereum network have a gas fee that needs to be paid in Ether, your account needs to have at least some Ether in it to perform any actions in the Marketplace.


## Buy MANA

To buy MANA in exchange for Ether, follow these steps:

1. Open your user _Settings page_.
2. Check the box next to _Assets using MANA_.

   > Note: Enabling this setting triggers a transaction on the blockchain. You must confirm this transaction in your Ethereum client, pay a gas fee in Ether and wait for its confirmation before it takes effect.

3. Click **Buy Mana**.
4. Set an amount of MANA you'd like to receive and click **Submit**.
5. Confirm this transaction on your Ethereum client and wait for the network to verify it.


## Give permissions

You can give another user permissions to edit the content in a parcel or Estate. This enables that user to deploy code to the scene, whilst not having the ability to sell the token.

The user given permission can also change the name or description in the Marketplace.

To grant permissions over your LAND:

1. Navigate to the details page of the parcel or Estate and click **Permissions**.

2. Click **Submit**.
3. Confirm this transaction on your Ethereum client and wait for the network to verify it.
